# sentiment-qris

This repository contains code and dummy data for QRIS (Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard) sentiment analysis. Please note that the data used is for demonstration and testing purposes only and does not represent real sentiments or opinions related to the QRIS policy.

I labeled sentiments using two methods:
1. Lexicon-based method. A method based on a word dictionary, often referred to as a lexicon-based method. The dictionary I used is the InSet Lexicon, which includes both positive and negative words.
2. Machine learning. In this step, i use pre-trained model called IndoBERT ndoBERT is a pre-trained language model based on BERT architecture for the Indonesian Language. This model is base-uncased version which use bert-base config.
